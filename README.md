# Electrodistica

Hi there!üëãüèº This is electrodistica, a website that will simplify those complicated csv files and help you to understand simple databases (basically, information about electricity consumption). Installation: To use this web, you have to install the paginaweb directory with everything inside it, and you must drag that directory, for example, to visual studio code, where you must run the app.py file. Once you have done that, either you go to the templates directory and open index.html, or you can go into your browser and type in the URL zone the following: 'localhost:5000' , without the single quotes. Either way will take you to an environment created by flask, where you will be able to interact with the web. IMPORTANT! -> The file to be uploaded to the web, once hosted, must be of csv type, and must contain at least 4 columns whose names are: "Date,Time,Consumption,datetime". To facilitate the testing of the software, a file located in the uploads directory is provided, whose name is electrodatos.csv. It is a database with the requested characteristics. The code is under GPLv3 license. This code was thought, programmed and implemented by Martin Hernandez, Daniel Quintero and me, Diego Rodriguez. Thanks to the Python Coru√±a group, specially to Martin and Roberto for helping us in moments of doubt and to the GPUL group for organizing the event!
